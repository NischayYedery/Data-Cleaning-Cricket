# Data-Cleaning-Cricket
Data Cleaning for Cricket Dataset: A comprehensive project focused on preprocessing cricket match data for analysis. This repository includes a raw dataset and a Jupyter Notebook that details the cleaning process—handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, removing duplicates, and preparing the data for visualization or modeling

Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive notebook dedicated to the cleaning and preprocessing of a cricket dataset. The dataset includes match statistics and performance data, and the project aims to ensure that the data is consistent, accurate, and ready for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

Files
CricketTestMatchData.csv: The raw dataset containing cricket match data.
Data Cleaning of cricket Database.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook detailing the step-by-step process of cleaning the dataset, including handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and formatting the data for analysis.
Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:

Handle Missing Data: Identifying and imputing or removing incomplete entries.
Standardize Formatting: Ensuring consistency in column names, date formats, and data types.
Remove Redundancy: Eliminate duplicate records to streamline the dataset.
Outlier Detection: Identifying and addressing anomalies in the data.
Feature Engineering: Creating new columns or modifying existing ones to enhance the dataset’s analytical potential.
Tools and Libraries
The following libraries are utilized in the cleaning process:

Pandas: For data manipulation and transformation.
NumPy: For handling numerical computations.

Key Insights
Before Cleaning: The dataset contained several inconsistencies, such as missing values, incorrect data types, and formatting issues.
After Cleaning: The processed dataset is well-structured and ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, or modeling.
Future Scope
This repository can serve as a starting point for:
